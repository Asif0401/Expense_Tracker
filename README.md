## Introduction


I've built a Complex Expense Budget Tracker. While building it, I've learnt many advanced React & JavaScript topics. Some of them are State Management in React, Context API, Local Storage, Material UI, and how to create a scalable React folder structure. But most importantly, I've learnt how to add voice capabilities to our applications using Speechly. 

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start```
